# sfp
An exercise done for my friend Steven.

It processes files in a folder and its sub-folders.

It requires Java 8 to run.

Usage:

1. copy the config.properties under src/main/resources folder to somewhere (e.g. C:\conf\config.properties) and modify it as you like.

2. mvn package

3. java -jar sfp.jar C:\conf\config.properties
